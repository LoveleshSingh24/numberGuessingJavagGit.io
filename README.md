This project was build as problem statement given by oasis as a intership program on JAVA DEVELOPMENT...

defining problem statement:
*The computer will generate the any number between 1 to 100, you as a user will have to guess what could be the number.
*For you to guess the number computer will provite hints that number you have guess is either greter or lower than the generated number.
*Remember only 10 chances will be given to you to guess the number.
*Computer will decide the score according your number of guess.


working of the project is explained by :
The game starts by displaying a message box asking the user to guess the number. 
The user then enters their guess in a dialogue box. The program checks if the guess matches the generated number or if it is too high or too low. 
If the guess is correct, 
a message box is displayed congratulating the user and asking if they want to play again. If the user chooses to play again, 
a new random number is generated and the game continues.
If the user chooses to quit, their final score (calculated based on the number of attempts) is displayed.




Hoping that project source code is readable and easily undersandable to all who are able to access this project!!

stay updated...
I will come up with more such project which will boost you intelligence and make you learn tech oriented skill.
